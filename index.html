        <section>
            <p> Let me throw you a scnenario you may be familiar with.</p>

            <p> You're working on a feature for a website or web app that requires some overriding overriding or
             other changes to the style of a component. You jump into Web Inspector, grab the class for the 
             element(s) in question, and write some new CSS. Easy. However, after refreshing the page, none of the
             changes have been made - or some have, but not all of them. Maybe the color changes, but the 
             margin-left: auto you gave the element remains the same.</p>

             <p> This is usually because of <strong>specificity</strong>. CSS specificity refers to the specificity
             of the conditions of a CSS selector. Here's an example.</p>

             <img src="images/code-01.png"/>
             
             <p>This selector has a low specificity, since it's just targeting an "a" element. Let's increase the
             specificity. </p>

             <img src="images/code-02.png"/>

             <p> This CSS is targeting an "a" element inside any element with a class of "modal". We could add a 
             condition to the class selector, too: </p>

             <img src="images/code-03.png"/>

             <p>Now the CSS is targeting "a" elements inside "div's" with a class of "model".</p>

             <p>The more conditions there are in a CSS selector, the higher its specificity. Specificity trumps
             the cascade, so in this case:</p>

             <img src="images/code-04.png"/>

             <p>Even though the rule on line 5 appears later in the stylesheet, its specificity is not as high as 
            the rule on line 1, so 'a' elements inside 'div's with a class 'a' model will appear green.</p>
             <h2>Calculating CSS specificity</h2>
             <p>Now that we understand the implications of selector specificity, let's get some hard numbers to help
             us diagnose specificity issues.</p>
 
             <p>people smarter than myself manages to come up with a numerical representation of CSS specificity, allowing
             us to calculate specificity scores. It works out like this:</p>
             <ul>
                 <li>Elements and pseudo-elements ('a, div, body, :before, :after') get a score of 1</li>
                 <li>classes and attribute selectors ('.element, [type="text"]') get a score of 10</li>
                 <li>IDs ('#header') get a score of 100</li>
                 <li>inline styles get a score of 1000</li>
             </ul>
 
             <p>Let's calculate the score for one of the ealrier examples.</p>
             
             <img src="images/code-05.png"/>
 
             <p>This Selector has:</p>
             <ul>
                 <li>5 elements (5)</li>
                 <li>1 class (10)</li>
                 <li>2 IDs (100)</li>
             </ul>
 
             <p>Giving it a total specificityscore of 215. You'd have to write a rule of equal or higher 
                 specificity to override the style applied to it.</p>
 
             <p>With the scoring in mind, take a look of the specificity graph for Dropbox's 'main.css' here. 
             You can see the graph spikes at a <span class="bold"> score of 532</span>. That means a CSS selector
             that looks something like this:</p>

             <img src="images/code-06.png"/>
 
             <p>Bear in mind this is the specificity of an actual selector of Dropbox's CSS today. Yikes.</p>
             <h2>Avoiding Over-Specific CSS</h2>
 
             <p>Avoiding writing oevrly-specified CSS rules takes just being mindful of a couple things.</p>
 
             <ol>
                 <li>Avoid nesting</li>
                 <li>Aim for low specificity when increasing specificity requirements.</li>
             </ol>
             <p>understanding how CSS specificity works will make things so much easier, and if you made it this far, 
             you should have a pretty good understanding bybiw!</p>
